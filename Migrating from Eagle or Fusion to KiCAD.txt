Converting Libraries
1. Save old libraries as .lbr files
2. Upload the library file to SnapEDA
  - https://www.snapeda.com/parts/add/
  - This will create footprint files and .zip files to download both the symbol and footprint
3. Create a folder for the library on your computer
4. Download using KiCAD (V6 or later)
5. Unzip and copy the files to the folder
6. Footprints convert as the following:
  - Pad -> Pad
  - Copper -> Cu
  - Silk -> Silkscreen
  - Values -> Silkscreen
  - Keepout -> Courtyard
  - Docu -> Fab
  - Paste -> Paste
  - Mask -> Mask
  - Restrict -> User.Drawings
    - There is no longer a plane restriction layer
  - Milling -> Oval Hole with Circular Pad
    - Need to update to Oval Pad as well
  - Drill -> Pad - NPTH, Mechanical (Non-Plated Through-Hole)
  - '>NAME' -> REF**
7. The footprint's name (value) is also displayed on the Fab layer
  - Uncheck it from the Footprint Properties... window
  - You may also need to disable showing Hidden Test from the Objects tab (by Layers)
8. Symbols convert (correctly) as the following:
  - Reference -> Reference (also fills in the '>NAME' with the reference)
  - Value -> Library Name (also fills in the '>VALUE' with the library name)
  - Pin Type -> Electrical Type (has the same options so easily maps)
9. You may also need to disable Show Hidden Fields from the spreadsheet button on the right side


Creating Libraries
1. Import Footprints
  - On KiCAD go to Preferences -> Manage Footprint Libraries...
  - Use Add Existing and select the folder containing the footprints
    - Add Existing is the folder icon at the bottom
2. Creating Footprints
  - Open the Footprint Editor
  - To create a new footprint folder follow the above steps
    - Footprint libraries are stored in folders and each footprint is a different file
  - Create a new footprint by selecting the folder and pressing New Footprint...
  - Footprints can have the following front (F) and back (B) layers:
    - Cu -> Defines where copper will be kept / placed
    - Adhesive -> Defines where adhesive should be applied
    - Paste -> Defines the areas that will get solder paste - and where stencils will be cut
    - Silkscreen -> Defines where silkscreen will be placed
    - Mask -> Defines where the solder mask will NOT be located - allowing solder to adhere
    - Courtyard -> Defines a bounding box around the component to help with routing
    - Fab -> Not put on PCB - used for manufacturing specific information
  - They can also have the following layers:
    - User.Drawings -> Customizable, used for personal reference annotations
    - User.Comments -> Customizable, used for personal comments and explanations
    - User.Eco(1,2) -> Engineering Change Order information
    - Edge.Cuts -> Defines the outline of the board
    - Margin -> Defines the minimum distance to the edge of the PCB - how they implement clearance
    - User.(1-9) -> Customizable
3. Creating Symbols - "Libraries"
  - Open the Symbol Editor
  - Create a new library with File -> New Library...
    - Add to Global so that it may be used by any project
  - To import existing symbols:
    - Right click on the library and select Import Symbol...
    - After importing the symbol you can delete the .kicad_sym file you imported
    - In KiCAD you can only map pins 1:1, however you can stack them and they will connect
  - To create a new symbol
    - Select the library and press New Symbol...
  - Click Symbol Properties...
    - Looks like an op-amp and settings symbol
    - Has options like making pin names visible etc.
  - Specify the Reference Designator in the Reference Field
  - To link a footprint click on the Value field and then select the ||\ symbol
    - Then use the Pin Table button next to Symbol Properties to assign the pins
    - The name of the pin must match the name of the pad
  - Find the footprint to link


Creating a New Project
1. Press New Project... (The folder with a star)
2. Name the project with dashes (-) between the words so GitHub accepts it
3. Editing Schematics:
  - Double click the .kicad_sch file from the hierarchy
  - Right-hand side bar:
    - (op-amp symbol) - Add Symbol button, A key, for adding parts
      - If parts text is added different from the library, go to Preferences -> Schematic Editor -> Editing Options
      - Uncheck Automatically place symbol fields
      - Note that once added from a library the parts are no longer linked and either can be edited without affecting the other
      - Pin headers and standard 100 mil headers can be found by searching for "CONN_"
        - Once placed edit the symbol and find the correct footprint by searching for "pinhead"
        - For standard dupont connectors scroll down to the 2.54mm section
      - Test points can be found in the connector library or by searching for "test"
        - Once placed edit the symbol and find the correct footprint by searching for "testpoint" or "testpoint_pad"
    - (ground symbol) - Add Power button, P key, for adding power symbols
    - (X symbol) - Add No Connect Flag, Q key, for adding a built in no-connect symbol
  - To add multiple sheets you need to use a hierarchical schematic
    - Press Add Sheet (bottom right side bar)
    - Draw a box which will let you click into the other sheets
    - Edit the name respectively
    - Right click on the box and press Enter Sheet to work on this "block"
    - To save the new sheet or "block" go to File -> Save Current Sheet Copy As...
    - To leave the sheet or "block" right click and select Leave Sheet
    - With this you now need to use the hierarchical labels to connect between sheets
      - Note this adds a "pin" connection to the "block"
      - To add this, right click the "block" and select Import Sheet Pin
4. Ensuring Schematic Readiness for layout:
  - Run Assign Footprints (link symbol, top right corner)
    - Verify every symbol has an assigned footprint
  - Schematic Setup (top left corner) should be fine with the defaults
  - Run the Electrical Rules Checker (ERC) (the checkbox on the top right)
  - Check the errors and warning that come up
  - Any errors that are intentional and understood can be excluded on a case-by-case basis
    - Right click on the error dialog and select Exclude This Violation
  - Check, exclude, and run until there are no more errors or warnings
5. Editing PCBs:
  - Double click the .kicad_pcb file from the hierarchy
  - To setup the board stack-up and design rules:
    - Open the Board Setup (top left corner)
    - For more than 2 layer boards edit the Physical Stackup section
      - Select the number of layers from the dropdown
      - Ensure the default correctly follows the manufacturer's process
    - In the Constraints section follow the specifications from the manufacturer, specifically:
      - Minimum Clearance is typically >0.15mm
      - Minimum track width is typically >0.15mm
      - Minimum connection width is typically >0.15mm
    - PCB way design rules used for cheapest boards:
      - Size: <100x100mm
      - Layers: 2
      - Material: FR-4
      - Thickness: 1.6mm
      - Min Track/Spacing: 6/6mil (0.1524mm)
      - Min Hole Size: 0.3mm
      - Finished Copper: 1oz
  - To add all the parts from the schematic:
    - Run Update PCB from Schematic.. (schematic/PCB symbol, top right corner)
  - Right-hand side bar:
    -
6. Exporting Gerber Files
  - Run the Design Rules Checker (DRC) (the checkbox on the top right)
  - Check the errors and warning that come up
  - Any errors that are intentional and understood can be excluded on a case-by-case basis
    - Right click on the error dialog and select Exclude This Violation
  - Check, exclude, and run until there are no more errors or warnings
  - To then export Gerber files, see the following recommendations on PCBWay:
