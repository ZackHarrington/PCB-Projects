General Notes:
- Fusion 360 does everything through Fusion Teams
- Designs now include an additional file that links everything together
  - This is what you should click to open the project
  - This now allows for multiple schematic and board layouts in one project


Importing Libraries
1. Create a new project and call it 'Libraries'
2. In the project select Upload and upload all the library files
  - Autodesk now creates a Fusion Teams copy of the library in the team
3. You can now double click on each library and edit all the attributes etc.
4. In the Content Manager tab of a library the icons at the top by the name show information about the library
  - Team logo (three people): This indicates the library is a Fusion Team library and can be edited
  - Link (two chains): This indicates the library is linked to a Library.io library and can be pushed
    - This is for adding changes if some team members are still on Eagle


Creating a New Project
1. Navigate to the Home section of the data panel
2. Press the blue New Project button
3. Double click on the new project to enter it
4. Either upload existing files or add a new electronics design tab in the main window
5. Add new schematics and board files from the main window 


Importing Projects
1. Create a new project
2. In the project select Upload and upload the board and schematic files
3. A prompt will appear asking you to create an electronics design, choose yes or click the checkbox if not filled
  - This is the additional file that will be linking the two together
4. Open the project by double clicking the new Electronics Design file (the one with no thumbnail image)
5. In the schematic, navigate to Library -> Update Design from Library (the single update image)
6. Assuming all custom libraries have been imported as shown above, all those used in the design should show up twice
  - One of these (the one without a version number) is a local reference used while importing old Eagle files
  - The other one (with a version number) is the Fusion Teams library
  - Autodesk is migrating to Fusion Teams and requires libraries to migrate to this format
7. Select the Fusion Team version of each library (the one with a version number) and update the libraries
8. Assuming the libraries had the same name, when you go to Library Manager only Fusion Team libraries should appear In Current Design (Team logo)


Editing Library.io Libraries
  - Traditional Eagle Pcb libraries (Library.io ones) will work fine in Fusion 360, however they aren't editable
  - To actually edit or modify a Library.io library you need to create a copy in Fusion Teams
1. First open a project and right click on one of the library components in the schematic
2. Select Open Component
3. A dialog will pop up letting you know it is creating a copy for editing, select Yes
4. The general reccomendation is to save this copy into the Libraries project
5. Follow the Importing Projects procedure from step 5 to then set this as the library to use in the project
  - If this doesnt work, go into the schematic and type the following command into the command line
  - UPDATE <NAME> <URN>
  - Where <NAME> is the library name, and <URN> is the Team URN number from the Content Manager Tab
