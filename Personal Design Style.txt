### Footprints
- Use package/footprint name from documentation, may be different from component name
- Pads:
	- Try to center all the pads
	- Name pins numerically.
	- Name ground pads 'PAD'
	- For identical names (when pads have multiple pieces of copper) add @# where the # increases numerically
	- Make sure 'Thermals' is checked, makes it easier to solder
	- For through hole pads make their diameter 1mm larger than the pin - or larger if the pin isn't round
- Outline:
	- Show mechanical size and actual metal contacts:
		- Layer: Fab, Width: 0.1mm
	- Silkscreen:
		- Layer: Silkscreen, Width: 0.15mm
		- Copy Fab layer but don't go over pads
		- For passive components also draw placement rectangle on courtyard excess with the same specifications
- Name:
	- 'REF**' - usually added automatically
	- Layer: Silkscreen, Size: 0.8mm, Thickness: 0.1mm, Align: Center
	- Place on 0.25mm grid
	- Above footprint
- Courtyard excess:
	- Only for non through-hole components
	- Drawn as rectangles unless the component is very oddly shaped
	- "the smallest rectangular area that can contain a component and its land pattern"
	- Layer: Courtyard, Width: 0.15mm
	- Place on 0.25mm grid around the component (can be between 0.1mm and 0.5mm from component)
	- Can place on 0.125mm grid for small components
- Pin 1 marking:
	- Add a circle by the first pin:
		- Layer: Silkscreen, Width: 0.1mm, Radius: 0.25mm
		- Inline with the top of pad 1, set just outside of the courtyard excess
	- Or fill in the cathode side:
		- Layer: Silkscreen
		- Try to stay out from under the physical component
- If possible, compare a 1:1 printout with a sample of the part you created before you order prototypes.

### Board Text
- Board Name:
	- Layer: Silkscreen, Size: 1.0mm, Thickness: 0.1mm
- Connector Names:
	- Layer: Silkscreen, Size: 1.2mm, Thickness: 0.1mm
- Information:
	- Layer: Silkscreen, Size: 1.2mm or 1.5mm, Thickness: 0.1mm
- Component Grouping Outlines:
	- Layer: Silkscreen, Width: 0.1524mm, Style: shortdash
- Board Soldermask Color:
	- Green: Standard, General purpose
		- Used by default because it gives the greatest contrast and visibility for copper and silkscreen
	- Red: WSU CIS, Bold, Professional
	- Yellow: Visibility
	- Blue: Industrial, Manufactured feel 
		- Used in consumer electronics (arduino) a lot for aesthetics
		- Ideal for mounting an LCD to
	- White: Clean, Sleak
		- Highlights specific features
	- Black: Modern, Sleak
		- Makes the metal parts standout more
		- Harder to inspect the board for defects
		- Sometimes used to signify where repairs were made
	- Purple: Slightly more elegant
		- Apparently used almost exclusively for submarine applications
- Board Silkscreen Color:
	- White: Standard, works for all but white
	- Black: Works best on white, possibly yellow
		- Probably wouldn't look great on anything else, there's not even really any google images of it on anything else 
	- Yellow: For added emphasis could work on green, anything else would be purely for aesthetics
