## Default Grids:
- Check the Options > Directories for the folder containing the scripts
- Open eagle.scr
- Change the Grid Default under any of the editor types to:
	- grid mm 0.5 mm lines on alt mm 0.1 mm;
- Edit mm to in if needed, and 0.5 or 0.1 to any desired number


### Footprints
- Double check personal library to see if one already exists.
- Use package/footprint name from documentation, may be different from component name
- Pads:
	- Try to center all the pads
	- Name pins numerically.
	- Name ground pads 'PAD'
	- For identical names (when pads have multiple pieces of copper) add @# where the # increases numerically
	- Make sure 'Thermals' is checked, makes it easier to solder
	- For through hole pads make their diameter 1mm larger than the pin - if the pin isn't round it'll need to be larger
- Slotted Holes:
	- Outline the hole:
		- Layer: Milling, Width: 0.01mm
	- Add a pad in the middle, making sure it fits within the perimeter of the outline
	- For the copper draw as a polygon on all necessary layers
	- Similarly, for the Stop draw as a polygon on all necessary layers
- Outline:
	- Show mechanical size and actual metal contacts:
		- Layer: tDocu, Width: 0.1mm
		- Can change the layer color: top yellow
	- Silkscreen:
		- Layer: tPlace, Width: 0.15mm
		- Copy tDocu layer but don't go over pads
		- For passive components also draw placement rectangle on courtyard excess with the same specifications
- Name/Value:
	- '>NAME'
	- No '>VALUE'
	- Layer: tNames, Size: 0.8mm, Ratio: 15%, Font: Vector, Align: Center
	- Place on 0.25mm grid
	- Above footprint
- Courtyard excess:
	- Only for not through-hole components
	- Drawn as rectangles unless the component is very oddly shaped
	- "the smallest rectangular area that can contain a component and its land pattern"
	- Layer: tKeepout, Width: 0.15mm
	- Place on 0.25mm grid around the component (can be between 0.1mm and 0.5mm from component)
	- Can place on 0.125mm grid for small components
- Pin 1 marking:
	- Add a circle by the first pin:
		- Layer: tPlace, Width: 0.5mm, Radius: 0.1mm
		- Inline with the top of pad 1
		- Set just outside of the courtyard excess, similar to the name
	- Or fill in the cathode side:
		- Layer: tDocu
		- Keep silkscreen out from under the physical component
- If possible, compare a 1:1 printout with a sample of the part you created before you order prototypes.
- To create a 3d model or Package for the footprint, right click the footprint name in the content manager and select Create New 3D Model


### Symbols
- Use the component name from the documentation
- Symbol outline:
	- 0.01 for outline width
	- Try to center the symbol
- Pins:
	- Group pins by function or how they appear on the physical package
	- Size: SHORT
	- Pin directions:
		- 'nc' - Not connected
		- 'in' - Input
		- 'out' - Output (totem-pole)
		- 'io' - Input / output (bidirectional)
		- 'oc' - Open collector or open drain
		- 'hiz' - High impedance (i.e 3-state)
		- 'pas' - Passive (for resistors, capacitors, etc.)
		- 'pwr' - Power input pin(Vcc, gnd, Vss, Vdd, etc.)
		- 'sup' - Supply (reserve for supply symbols)
	- Naming:
		- Follow datasheet
		- '!' indicates active low (!RESET)
		- '!R!/W' will place a bar over the 'R' only.
		- For identical names add @# where the # is the pin number
- Name:
	- '>NAME'
	- Layer: Names, Size: 0.07/0.05, Ratio: 8%, Font: Proportional, Align: Center/Center_Left
	- Above symbol
- Value: 
	- '>VALUE'
	- Layer: Values, Size: 0.07/0.05, Ratio: 8%, Font: Proportional, Align: Center/Center_Left
	- Below symbol
- Info:
	- '>VOLTAGE'
	- Layer: Info, Size: 0.07/0.05, Ratio: 8%, Font: Proportional, Align: Center/Center_Left
	- Below symbol
	- Add attributes as logical, i.e. capacity, voltage, temperature coefficient
